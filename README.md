# sql-task6-subqueries

## 🧠 Objective
To demonstrate the use of **scalar**, **correlated**, and **nested subqueries** in SQL by writing queries using subqueries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `FROM` clauses.

## 🛠 Tools Used

## 📁 Files Included
- `subquery_exercises.sql` – Contains all SQL queries using subqueries and nested logic.

## 📌 Key Concepts Practiced
- Scalar Subqueries
- Correlated Subqueries
- Subqueries in `SELECT` clause

- Subqueries in `FROM` clause (Derived Tables)
- Use of `IN`, `EXISTS`, and nested filtering

## 🧪 Sample Queries Included
- Find employees earning above average salary
